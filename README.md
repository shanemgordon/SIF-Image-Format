# SIF Image Format
 An image format I made at the end of my C++ Studies last year

The SIF (Shane Image Format) was an end of the year experiment from my studies in C++. A modification of the standard PPM file, the SIF file can be converted, displayed and scaled in this software. The format for each pixel in an SIF file is randomized between RGB, Binary and Hexadecimal, meaning this file will be difficult to decipher without this program.

SIF Image files also have the unique header attribute of having a scale for each pixel, meaning each pixel can be displayed larger or smaller on the display depending on how it was configured when it was created.
